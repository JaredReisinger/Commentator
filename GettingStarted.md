# Getting Started

There's not much to getting started with Commentator... once you've installed it
into Visual Studio and restarted, it's running by default.  Commentator does its
best to only kick in when it's confident it should be wrapping a comment.  If at
any time it seems to be misbehaving, please log an issue on GitHub.  If you need
to turn Commentator off, you can do so via its Tools.Options setting.
