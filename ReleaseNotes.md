# Release Notes

## v0.1.4 (01-Jan-2014)

First public release.

Only single-line comments ("//"-to-end-of-line) are wrapped to ensure DocComment-style
and other comments aren't accidentally flattened.  (First, do no harm!)

Overall auto-wrapping feature and wrap-column can be configured in Tools.Options.
